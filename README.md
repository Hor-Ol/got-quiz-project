## :thought_balloon: Idea

On the site user can go through the quiz guessing which character said the quote to verify his/her knowledge of The Game of Thrones and check how good he/she will be in the role of The Hand of the Throne.

## :dart: Main Goals 

The project was made upon finishing â‰ˆ30% of React course and had the goal to structure & strengthen the knowledge of the concepts learned, such as states, hooks, CSS modules and working with fetch API. The idea was to practice React fundamentals and key features as well as to get experience with fetching data and working with received data, handling potential errors, etc.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

1. React
2. CSS Modules
3. Fetch API

## :mag: Things to Improve

1. The project is using props drilling, however using context could be a better solution.
